[Upload your bill image/PDF]
```

## 🗃️ Database Schema

### Finance Schema
- **Transactions Table**: Stores all income and expense records
- **Categories**: Predefined expense and income categories
- **Users**: User financial profiles

### Auth Schema
- **Users Table**: User authentication information
- **Roles**: User role definitions

## 📊 Expense Categories

- FOOD_AND_DINING

## 💰 Income Categories

- SALARY
- BUSINESS
- INVESTMENTS
- FREELANCE
- RENTAL

## 🔍 OCR Processing

The OCR Parser Service uses Tesseract OCR to:
1. Extract text from uploaded bill images
2. Parse relevant financial information (amount, date, merchant)
3. Auto-populate transaction forms
4. Support multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF)

## 📈 Analytics Features

- **Spending Breakdown**: Pie charts showing expenses by category
- **Monthly Trends**: Track spending patterns over time
- **Income vs Expenses**: Compare earnings and expenditures
- **Budget Analysis**: Monitor budget adherence
- **Category-wise Reports**: Detailed category analysis

## 🐳 Docker Services

The application consists of the following Docker services:

- `postgres`: Unified Postgres service with schema-level isolation
- `upsert-service`: Transaction management microservice
- `auth-service`: Authentication microservice
- `bill-parser-service`: Bill processing microservice
- `analytics-service`: Data analytics microservice
- `api-gateway`: API Gateway for routing requests
- `prometheus`: Metrics scraper
- `grafana`: Visualization dashboards
- `clickhouse`: Observability log store
- `fluent-bit`: Log shipper to ClickHouse

## 🛠️ Development

### Local Development Setup
1. Start the unified database:
   ```bash
   docker compose up postgres -d
   ```

2. Run services locally:
   ```bash
   cd auth-service && mvn spring-boot:run
   cd upsert-service && mvn spring-boot:run
   # ... repeat for other services
   ```

### Building Services
```bash
# Build all services
docker-compose build

# Build specific service
docker compose build upsert-service
```

## Observability Quick Checks

```bash
docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:9090/-/healthy
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
curl http://localhost:8123/ping
```

- Grafana dashboards are provisioned from `observability/grafana/dashboards`.
- Prometheus scrape config is at `observability/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.
- Fluent Bit pipeline config is at `observability/fluent-bit/fluent-bit.conf`.

## 🔒 Security

- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Secure password storage with bcrypt hashing
- API Gateway filters for request validation
- Role-based access control
- Database connection security

## 🧪 Testing

Use the provided HTTP requests in your `requests` folder to test the API endpoints. Make sure to:

1. First authenticate to get a JWT token
2. Include the token in subsequent requests
3. Test all CRUD operations for transactions
4. Verify OCR functionality with sample bills
